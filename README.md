Nested discrete event simulation module for the Aivika library

The represented [aivika-branches](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aivika-branches) package extends 
the [aivika-transformers](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aivika-transformers) 
library and allows creating branches to run nested simulations within simulation. 
The branches are very cheap but still not free.

To run the simulation experiment by the Monte-Carlo method, you can use additional packages.
They will allow you to save the simulation results in SQL database and then generate a report
consisting of HTML pages with charts, histograms, links to CSV tables, summary statistics and so on.
Please consult the [AivikaSoft](http://www.aivikasoft.com) website for more details.
